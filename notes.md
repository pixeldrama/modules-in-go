# Notes

- Go version tags, go.sum interaction with go proxy, what happens during manipulations
- Copy go.mod and go.sum first and then resolve dependencies, better approach?
- Go workspace good real life examples
- Price for multi major versions comes with a high cost because you have to change module path in each file when this happens

- Mise-en-place (go mod)
